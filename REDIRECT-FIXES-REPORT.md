# Redirect Fixes Report

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Issue**: "Too many redirects" errors affecting site accessibility  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issues Found
1. **Conflicting redirect files**: Both `_redirects` and `netlify.toml` were processing simultaneously
2. **Redirect loops**: `/es/` and `/articles/` were redirecting to `/:page/` causing infinite loops
3. **Cache conflicts**: Cache exclusion headers were preventing redirects from working
4. **Priority issues**: Redirect rules were not in the correct order

### Root Cause
The main issue was a conflicting `_redirects` file with broad rules like `/:page.html → /:page/` that were matching paths like `/es/` and causing redirect loops.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Conflicting `_redirects` File ✅
- **Action**: Deleted the problematic `_redirects` file
- **Reason**: It contained rules that created redirect loops
- **Files**: `_redirects` → deleted

### 2. Clean netlify.toml Configuration ✅
- **Action**: Created a clean, hierarchical redirect structure
- **Priority order**:
  1. Specific HTML to slash redirects
  2. Quiz page redirects
  3. Main page serves
  4. Article/category index serves
  5. General redirects
- **Files**: `netlify.toml` → completely restructured

### 3. Removed Cache Exclusions ✅
- **Action**: Removed `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers for HTML files
- **Reason**: These were preventing redirects from working
- **Result**: Redirects now process correctly

### 4. Added Specific High-Priority Redirects ✅
- **Action**: Added specific redirects for key pages
- **Examples**:
  - `/articles/wallets.html` → `/articles/wallets/` 301
  - `/es/articulos/carteras.html` → `/es/articulos/carteras/` 301

## Test Results

```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Test key URLs weekly** to ensure redirects remain functional

4. **Verify cache headers** don't interfere with redirects

✅ **VERIFIED**: All sitemap pages accessible  
✅ **OPTIMIZED**: Clean redirect hierarchy implemented
